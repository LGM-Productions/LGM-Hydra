## Tell me more, please!

As you wish. This project is made with JavaScript, the same language that Scratch 3.0 runs off of. Games can be sumbitted to it, and if approved, they'll go on a server which can be accessed via the included shop. You can then download these games and play them offline or online through a little UI magic!

## What do I need to run this Project?

LGM Hydra is now an ElectronJS executable, so that means all the dependencies come packaged with it. That's a good thing for you, since all you need is that now! You can get the lastest version from the [releases section](https://github.com/Cubix-Dev/SNext/releases/latest) to the right.

~~## Wait a minute. Isn't this just Turbowarp then?
Well, not quite. First of all, SNext isn't an editor.. Although we now have our own editor called [SN-Edit](https://cubixdev.org/SN-Edit/). Second, this is a console. Not an *emulator*. SNext is designed to run games from a seperate system mostly without an internet connection or the limitations of an everyday browser. Also, does TurboWarp have a custom server running to host games? Ok, maybe they do, but it isn't as cool as ours!~~

## Wow, this sounds fun! How do I add my game to the console?
Well the short answer is you don't. With SNext no longer being supported by our team, we're not adding any new games at this time. However you can still develop for our new project! available in our [discord community](https://dsc.gg/cubix)
~~Just head to [this link](https://forms.gle/Rbt1ELbr8HPgEh2q9). You can also join our Discord, [here](https://discord.gg/mqGKmRw9MY).~~

## wOaH! This is cool. Now add this feature!

In general if you want a feature added, ~~simply create a feature request [here](https://github.com/Cube-Enix/SNext/issues/new/choose). Once a dev sees it, we'll give it a cool tag to show the status if your idea. Once we add it you'll be credited for suggesting it!~~ you'll need to make a fork and add it yourself, sorry ðŸ˜­

## Building from Source

###### I'm gonna take this time to warn you that this is **NOT** the recommended way to build SNext. The only time this should be done is when you are attempting to tackle an issue.
1. Download the files.
2. Make sure you have both [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) ready.
3. Clone the repo into a folder on your system.
4. (WINDOWS ONLY)  Navigate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then right click on the file called `install.ps1` and click on 'Run with Powershell'. If you get an error about security, see [this](https://www.danielengberg.com/powershell-check-execution-policy/).

<b>We dont recommend using install.ps1. Use</b> `install.bat` <b>instead</b>

4. (LINUX ONLY) Navigate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then open it in the terminal and run: `./install.sh`.
5. Navagate to the directory that you downloaded/cloned SNext to. Then, navigate to `src` and run `npm start`.

<!-- 
Please note that you'll get an error, stating that there were no files to run. **THIS IS INTENDED BEHAVIOUR. DO NOT REPORT THIS AS A BUG. SNEXT  WILL STILL COMPILE SUCCESSFULLY. ** -->

<!-- ## Features on their way
- Discord Rich Presense
- Automatic Game Loading
- Auto Updating
- eShop Intergration
-->
